- revisit instantiateL and instantiateR algo
- product types:
    - think out: 
        - Product type literal
        - How to construct a anonymous product type (maybe something akin to a record)
        - How to construct a named type 
        - How would we handle structural and nominal typing 
            - proposition: 
            ```elixir
                defmodule User do
                    defstruct name: "John", age: 27
                end
                a = %User{}
                [:__struct__, :age, :name] = Map.keys a 
             ```
             Nominal types could be implemented using the special :__struct__ tag in a structural type

- remove 'case _ =>' matches
